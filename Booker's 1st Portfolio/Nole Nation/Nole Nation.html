            <h2>Could Booker Flowers be the next QB for Florida State?</h2>
            <p>Coming out of the prison and
                going back to school at 50 years old. Still agile and very accurate with a pigskin. The
                Noles need a quarterback with skill and expierence and the old man has shown himself to
                be skilled and very capable with the ball.
                He's not even afraid to run the ball, leaving the youngsters in his dust as he propels
                himself to the in-zone. Most QB's head for the sideline to avoid being hit. Mr. Flowers
                said and I quote "They hit like high school girls, I love the way the stop and fall when they attempt
                to tackle me. I always here John Madden saying 'Did you get the number of that truck!'
                or 'He did'nt see that one coming' as I run on to the touch down."
                Lets see them keep us out of the playoffs this year. If he is not our next quarter back
                he is definatly our next running back!</p>
            <details>
                <summary>Who's Booker?</summary>
                <p>
                    Not your average QB, this guy is 50 years old and still moving like a 20 year old.
                    No limit to the amount of effort and atheletisism he'll bring to the game. The surprise
                    is in the transformation once the game starts. First your thinking what's up with pop's being
                    out here, and then it's like "Who brought that truck on the field!" Passing accuracy is about 95% on
                    target every time. He'll stay in the pocket when able but is a run threat at all times and is not afraid
                    to run through a defensive line leaving your rushers and other linemen on their backs.

            <h2>The future of Seminole football is in the hands of the Flowers family</h2>
            <p>Who have joined thier Father/Grand Father
                on the Noles roster. There is Vincent Flowers at Wide Reciever, the kids a bullet shotting off the line
                like
                the flash. DeAnthony Flowers at running back- just like the old man this guys a brick house and hard to
                bring
                down. Booker Flowers Jr. is a red shirt already on the starting line-up on the defensive side of the
                ball.
                Breaking
                through the line 7 out of every 10 tries for a sack each time.
                This guy even has his granddaughter Maya playing on special teams as the punter and field-goal kicker.
                Said he
                had a revelation after watching her kick an offending boyfriend in the nards!

                News fresh off the Noles Press Line: Twinkle Toes, The New Flash, Lightening Roberts has just accepted a
                full
                atheletic scholarship to FSU. This is the only man to have beaten Usain Bolt in the 100 meter dash and
                is reported to
                have said in passing him "your moving to slow!" A very reliable source say's that he is on the roster as
                our starting running back. Nole fans, the future Seminole football is shaping up to be a real
                championship team. Keep
                it locked on this
                web site for future updates.
                <details>
                    <summary>What Roberts brings to the game!</summary>
                    <p>
                        Over three hundred rushing yards a game on average, has only fumbled once in his entire career and 
                        has a history of run backs for touchdowns on special teams. In fact his college coach said and I quote
                        "Every time he touches the ball on a punt return or kickoff, there is a 80% chance he scores."
                        Roberts has also proven himself as a team leader and an amazing asset to any team.
