                        I compete in Fly Ball competitions with my Border Collie Taz, Taz was really great in training
                        with
                        me but seemed
                        to fall apart a major competitions with the crowd. I could'nt figure out how to get him over
                        that
                        hurtle so I turned
                        to the professionals at (B&MA). I never thought that the owner would see to my dog personally
                        but I
                        asked and he communicate
                        out an worked with Taz himself. So far we have won four Fly Ball competitions in Daytona Beach
                        and
                        one in Hollywood. These
                        guys are the real deal when it comes to training and customer service.
