            <p>"Let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath/anger: For wrath/anger of
                man worketh not the righteousness of God"

            <p>
                These word were spoken in James, chapter 1:19-20; could it be that our quickness to become angry
                leads to the start of our troubles? How often do you become angry in a day? How many times does that
                anger lead you towards violence? What ways can you deal with your anger in a way that takes you out of
                the danger zone and allows you to concentrate on what the real issues are?
            </p>
            <p>
                Take your time and meditate on this and consider what can be done to remove yourself from the
                reaction mode and enter in to the response mode. Plan how you will respond to negativity and
                conflict which will surely come in your life.

            <h2>Reaction Mode</h2>
            <p> What is a reaction? For this lesson we will define it as a knee jerk. If someone hits your knee
                with a mallet your knee will automatically jerk. This is also true in our lives! If someone pushes the
                right buttons we normal react with a knee jerk. That is the angry and violent response that kicks in and
                leads us down dangerous paths. Over and over again no matter how much distruction this has already
                caused
                in our lives we tend to follow the same path.
            </p>
            <p>
                How long will you follow the same path? Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a
                different result is "insanity"! Are we truely insane? Are you still doing the same thing over and
                over and receiving the same results?

            <h2>Listening and Contemplating</h2>
            <p>
                "Let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath/anger: For wrath/anger of
                man worketh not the righteousness of God"

            <p>
                Have you ever sat at the feet of an elder(mother, father, grandparent, etc...) and listen as they
                gave instructions or told a story? How much did you learn simply by listening and thinking on what
                they were saying? Did you contemplate on what they had told you or explained to you later in your time
                alone?
            </p>
            <p>
                Taking the time to think on what we have heard and what we have learned can have an amazing effect
                on our understanding of the issue. We should always listen first, hold all questions and comments
                while we fully hear what is being said. Than we should take the time to think on what we have heard
                before giving a reply.

                After thinking on what we have heard we should follow the next few steps before replying.

                I can personally do whatever I wish but not all things are condusive to a peaceful life and I
                have the power to make this a fight or a moment of clarity. Not only for myself but also the other
                individual(s).
